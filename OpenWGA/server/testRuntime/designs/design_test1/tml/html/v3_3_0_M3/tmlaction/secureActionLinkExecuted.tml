This test consists of 3 tml-modules:
- secureActionLinkDefine (renders the action and the link) 
- secureActionLinkExecuted (does an asserttrue - action executed)
- secureActionLinkNotExecuted (does an asserttrue - action not executed)

The whole test checks:
- the rendered actionlinks can only be used in the corresponding session (session they have been rendered in)
  -> this prevent that a link which is copied from the browser-addressbox cannot be executed by another user or browserinstance
