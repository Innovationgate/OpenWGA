step.view.headline=<h1>Welcome to the OpenWGA initialization wizard</h1>
step.view.infotext=\
	In the course of the following steps your OpenWGA server will get a base configuration.<br><br>\
	This includes the following operations:<br>\
	<ul>\
	<li>Setup a secure administrative login for accessing the OpenWGA admin client</li>\
	<li>Setup authentication for content authors and create an authoring account with manager rights</li>\
	<li>Connect to a database server on which you can create your web applications</li>\
	</ul>\
	Some of these steps may be skipped and performed later in OpenWGA admin client. However if you are not yet familiar with the platform we recommend that you completely initialize your OpenWGA server with this wizard. 
	


step.admin.headline=<h1>Setup admin login</h1>
step.admin.infotext=To access the administration resources of your OpenWGA Server you will need an administrative login.<br><br>\
	A default admin login with username "<b>admin</b>" and password "<b>wga</b>" is preconfigured on every new OpenWGA server. But to protect your server against unauthorized administrative access, you should change this default login now.<br><br>\
	The login information that you enter below will replace the default login.
	
	
step.admin.username=Username
step.admin.password=Password
step.admin.password2=Repeat password
step.admin.passwords-not-match=The two password fields do not match.

step.auth.headline=<h1>Setup simple authentication for authors</h1>
step.auth.infotext=This step allows you to create a simple authentication source so you can define author users in it.<br><br>\
	It consists of a simple XML file named "<b>auth.xml</b>", containing user and group definitions, that is stored in the OpenWGA configuration directory under: <b>{1}</b>.<br><br>\
	Also one author user will be created in this file that OpenWGA will use as "default manager", i.e. the user will automatically have manager rights on all created applications which allows him all content management operations. <br><br>\
	If you need to use a special authentication source (An LDAP directory server for example, available if you use the OpenWGA enterprise edition) you may skip this step and configure it later in OpenWGA admin client. You will find the authentication configuration there under <b>Domains / Domain "default"</b>.<br><br>\
	To setup simple authentication specify the login information of the default manager user below. 
	

step.auth.create-authXML=Create auth.xml
step.auth.creation-failed=Cannot create the file based authentication source!

step.db-server.headline=<h1>Create a database server definition</h1>
step.db-server.infotext=This step will connect OpenWGA to a database server by adding a database server definition to the OpenWGA configuration.<br>\
	Database servers are necessary to host the databases that will store the content data of your web applications.<br><br>\
	A database server that is embedded to OpenWGA named "<b>HSQL default database directory</b>" is already available and configured. It is suitable for testing and developing purposes. If you want to use this you may skip this step.<br><br>\
	However if you have a production grade database server on your system that is supported by OpenWGA (MySQL for example) then you should connect OpenWGA to it and use it for content storage.<br><br>\
	Below is a list of the supported database servers of your current installation. Some of these may not yet be available because of missing dependencies - explained in red text - which you may want to resolve before continuing. Select a server from the list below or skip this step if none is available or you want to use the embedded server:
	

step.finish.headline=<h1>Confirmation</h1>
step.finish.infotext=We now have gathered all neccessary information to initialize your OpenWGA server.<br><br>\
	Following you see a summary of the steps that the initialisation is to perform now. Please review the given data and click the confirm buttom to start the initialisation process.<br><br>\
	After the initialisation has finished you will be taken to the OpenWGA start page. There you will find a link to the <b>OpenWGA admin client</b> where you can continue to setup your server.
