ServiceProblem.title=A problem was detecting setting up REST service for app '{dbkey}'
ServiceProblem.DisabledButNeeded.message=The application needs REST service APIs but the service is disabled
ServiceProblem.DisabledButNeeded.description=The application has determined that it needs a number of REST APIs enabled to work properly. However the REST service is disabled globally in server configuration. Therefor the application may not work as expected.
ServiceProblem.DisabledButNeeded.solution=You can enable "OpenWGA Web Services REST service" in admin client, Menu "Configuration", "Basic Settings". You will need to reconnect this app for this problem to go away afterwards. If you want to keep it disabled and you know that your usage of the app does not involve REST services then you can also configure the publisher option "REST services: Enabled APIs" of that app to not demand any APIs.
