<BODY>
Basic functionality of the WGAPI including most of the database-independent functionality.
When you work with the WGAPI you will rarely access any other classes than these from this package.
<p>Main entry point for working with the WGAPI is the class {@link de.innovationgate.webgate.api.WGFactory WGFactory} which is a singleton that is aquired by it's static getInstance() method.</p>
<p>The WGFactory can open Databases by it's method openDatabase. The returned objects are of type {@link de.innovationgate.webgate.api.WGDatabase WGDatabase}. From there you can retrieve the data of WGA databases as descendants of {@link de.innovationgate.webgate.api.WGDocument WGDocument}.</p>
