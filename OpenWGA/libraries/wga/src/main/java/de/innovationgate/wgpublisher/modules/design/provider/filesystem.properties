dp.title=File System Design Provider
dp.description=A provider serving the design from a WGA design directory
defaultdp.title=Default File System Design Source

option.noBackgroundChanges.title=No background changes on design
option.noBackgroundChanges.description=Enable this if the files of this design directory will not be modified "in the background" i.e. by direct file manipulation outside OpenWGA. If they are only updated using OpenWGA design synchronisation the design file cache can skip many file system update checks and improve multithreading performance. This can also be globally enabled in the basic server configuration.

option.sync.title=Synchronize design into WGA Content Store
option.sync.description=Enabling this option will synchronize the data of the design directory into the WGA Content Store and serve it from there. Otherwise it will directly be read from the directory files when needed. Note that enabling this is only neccessary if you use Content Store Synchronisation and want it to sync content AND design data from this database. Note also that some WGA5 design directory features are not compatible with this option.

option.autoupdate.title=Automatically poll for design updates
option.autoupdate.description=When synchronizing design is enabled this controls if WGA runs a polling task that automatically picks up changes in the design directory. If this is disabled WGA will not notice changes to the design directory when in sync mode.

option.designkey.title=Design key of design directory
option.designkey.description=When synchronizing design is enabled you must specify the design key of the directory to use in this option. You find the design key inside the syncinfo.xml file of the directory. This prevents picking the wrong directory and overwriting the designs in database with it.

option.variants.title=Enable design variants
option.variants.description=When enabled WGA will try to lookup special design documents for the consumer database, that differ from those served for other databases. The name of those special design documents are suffixed with a point plus the database key of the consumer database, like "designname.designkey".
