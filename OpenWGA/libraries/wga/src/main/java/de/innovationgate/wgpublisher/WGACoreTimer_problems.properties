taskFailed.title=The scheduled problem determination task failed to run.
taskFailed.exception.message=An error happened running the task.
taskFailed.exception.description=See the problem exception stack trace for details.

cacheProblem.title=A problem regarding caching was detected.
cacheProblem.dataLowUtilisation.message=The WGAPI data cache has a low utilisation
cacheProblem.dataLowUtilisation.description=The data cache utilisation is only {utilisation}%. Many data requests therefor need to be served from the database. This may indicate the cache size being too low, but may also be ok when the cause is just frequently changing data.
cacheProblem.dataLowUtilisation.solution=You might try to increase the WGAPI data cache maximum size. If the database has frequently changing data this cache behaviour may be expected and you can simply confirm this problem.

cacheProblem.documentLowUtilisation.message=The document cache of database "{dbkey}" has low utilisisation.
cacheProblem.documentLowUtilisation.description=The document cache utilisation of database "{dbkey}" is only {utilisation}%. Many data requests therefor need to be served from the database. This may indicate the cache size being too low, but may also be ok when the cause is just frequently changing data.
cacheProblem.documentLowUtilisation.solution=You might try to increase the WGAPI data cache maximum size. If the database has frequently changing data this cache behaviour may be expected and you can simply confirm this problem.

luceneProblem.title=A problem with the Lucene fulltext index has been detected.
luceneProblem.managerDead.message=The lucene manager is dead.
luceneProblem.managerDead.description=Some error has prevented the lucene manager from being initialized. Without lucene manager there will be no fulltext indexing. Also other errors are to be expected.
luceneProblem.managerDead.solution=Check other problems or the application log for what might have prevented the lucene manager from starting. Sometimes a corrupt index is the cause. In that case shutdown OpenWGA, delete the contents of the folder "wgadata/#lucene" below OpenWGAs config path (where wgaconfig.xml is located) and start it again to let it rebuild the index.
luceneProblem.indexerDead.message=The lucene indexer is dead.
luceneProblem.indexerDead.description=Some error has prevented the lucene indexer from being initialized. Without lucene indexer there will be no fulltext indexing. Also other errors are to be expected.

In that case shutdown OpenWGA, delete the contents of the folder "wgadata/#lucene" below OpenWGAs config path (where wgaconfig.xml is located) and start it again to let it rebuild the index.
luceneProblem.indexerNotRunning.message=The lucene indexer has not been running for {time} minutes.
luceneProblem.indexerNotRunning.description=When the indexer does not run then lucene fulltext searches will not use up-to-date data. The indexer may be stalling or constantly failing because of other problems.
luceneProblem.indexerNotRunning.solution=Check if the lucene indexer is running in admin client under "Runtime>Status>WGA Server". If so and you are currently rebuilding the index for a large app then check if there are messages in the log that prove that the indexer is still working. If so everything most likely is ok. Otherwise look for other problems that may keep lucene indexer from running. If no other problems can be found examine the application log for possible causes.

luceneProblem.lowSpace.message=The left disk space for the lucene index is low
luceneProblem.lowSpace.description=The currently left disk space in the lucene index directory is {freespace} MB while the lucene index size is {indexsize} MB. The left space should at least be two times the index size. Otherwise indexing optimization operations may fail, resulting in a broken index. The current index directory path is: {dir}
luceneProblem.lowSpace.solution=Move the lucene index directory to a file system path with enough free space. You can choose a directory in admin client when "expert mode" is enabled under menu "Configuration", "Advanced configuration", tab "Lucene engine".

systemProblem.title=A problem regarding the operating system platform was detected.

systemProblem.lowDataSpace100.message=The left disk space for the OpenWGA data directory is low
systemProblem.lowDataSpace100.description=The currently left disk space in the data directory is {freespace} MB. The left space should be at least above 100 MB, but a much higher free disk space of 1 GB or higher is recommended. The current data directory path is: {dir}
systemProblem.lowDataSpace100.solution=Move the OpenWGA data directory to a file system path with enough free space. It can be chosen with Java system variable de.innovationgate.wga.datapath.

systemProblem.lowTempSpace100.message=The left disk space for the temporary files is low
systemProblem.lowTempSpace100.description=The currently left disk space in the temp directory is {freespace} MB. The left space should be at least above 100 MB, but a much higher free disk space of 1 GB or higher is recommended. The current temp directory path is: {dir}
systemProblem.lowTempSpace100.solution=Move the OpenWGA data directory to a file system path with enough free space. It can be chosen with Java system variable de.innovationgate.wga.datapath.

dbConnProblem.title=A problem occured regarding connections to backend databases.

dbConnProblem.serverLowPoolWarn.message=The connection pool of database server "{servername}" is low on free connections
dbConnProblem.serverLowPoolWarn.description=The pool currenty uses {numactive} connections, which is at least 50% of the {maxactive} connections that are available.
dbConnProblem.serverLowPoolWarn.solution=If this status persists you should look if those connections are actually used all the time or if most of them are "hanging", i.e they are not released although their processing has ended. In the first case you should evaluate if you can increase the maximum size of the pool. If you believe connections to be hanging then you should search the application log for error conditions that may leave connections in hanging state. 
 
dbConnProblem.serverLowPoolCrit.message=The connection pool of database server "{servername}" is very low on free connections
dbConnProblem.serverLowPoolCrit.description=The pool currenty uses {numactive} connections, which is at least 80% of the {maxactive} connections that are available. It is possible that the pool will get exhausted and requests are going to be rejected.

dbConnProblem.dbLowPoolWarn.solution=If this status persists you should look if those connections are actually used all the time or if most of them are "hanging", i.e they are not released although their processing has ended. In the first case you should evaluate if you can increase the maximum size of the database pool or switch to a larger shared connection pool for the complete database server. If you believe connections to be hanging then you should search the application log for error conditions that may leave connections in hanging state.

loggerProblem.title=A problem ocurred regarding access logging.
loggerProblem.noLogging1Minute.message=The access logger did not run for at least 1 minute.
loggerProblem.noLogging1Minute.description=The access logger normally logs the accesses that occurred every 10 seconds but did not finish any logging run in the last minute. This may mean that either there is very much to log in one logging run or that the logger has a problem. Both conditions may endanger system memory when there are more accesses to log coming in than are actually logged.
loggerProblem.noLogging1Minute.solution=You may want to search other problems or the application log for information about why the logging has stalled. You can re-create the access logger by reloading the WGA configuration.

loggerProblem.noLogging5Minutes.message=The access logger did not run for at least 5 minutes.
loggerProblem.noLogging5Minutes.description=The access logger normally logs the accesses that occurred every 10 seconds but did not finish any logging run in the last 5 minutes. This most likely means that the logger has a problem. The logging queue has been cleared so it will not float the servers memory.
loggerProblem.noLogging5Minutes.solution=You may want to search other problems or the application log for information about why the logging has stalled. You can re-create the access logger by reloading the WGA configuration.
