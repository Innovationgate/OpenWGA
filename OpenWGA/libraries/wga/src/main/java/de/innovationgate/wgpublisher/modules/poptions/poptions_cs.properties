option.AllowBrowsing.title=Browsing allowed
option.AllowBrowsing.description=Controls if it is possible to directly address content documents in the URL via any content key. If this is false then it will only be possible to call contextless WebTML modules on this application. This option is obsolete. Use option "Browsing Security" instead.

option.BrowsingSecurity.title=Browsing security
option.BrowsingSecurity.description=This setting controls how content data in this application may be accessed on the Internet. "No Authoring" means the app cannot be opened in Content Manager or similar authoring apps. "No content addressing" means that it will be impossible to address content documents via URL (content key, unique name, title etc.) so the application design has full control over the content that is displayed.

option.PersMode.description=Controls the type of personalisation to use on this content store.

option.PersMode.OptIn.title=Personalisation: User opt-in for persistent storage
option.PersMode.OptIn.description=With this enabled a new user profile will stay in transient mode until the user confirms that he wants to persistently store user data. The design must offer a functionality to ask this confirmation. No persistent cookie will be sent while the profile is transient. If the session exists without the confirmation then the in-memory user profile is discarded.

option.PortletRegistryMode.title=Portlet registry mode
option.PortletRegistryMode.description=Force a mode for the portlet registry. This normally is decided by the compliance version of the apps design. Version >= 6.2 chooses transient registry, versions below choose persistent registry.

option.TitlePathURL.title=Title path URLs
option.TitlePathURL.description=Enables the usage and generation of Title path URLs for this database. This feature makes the URLs that adress content in this database look more userfriendly, as they will include the titles of the addressed document and their parent documents. This comes for the price of less "uniqueness" of these URLs and the possibility of name conflicts. 

option.TitlePathURL.ContentIndexing.title=Title path URLs: Use content indexing
option.TitlePathURL.ContentIndexing.description=Enables content indexes on Title Path URLs. This allows title path URLs to address documents with equal titles on the same path but may drain performance significantly if there are struct entries with many siblings in the database.

option.TitlePathURL.ShortcutArea.title=Title path URLs: Default area
option.TitlePathURL.ShortcutArea.description=Specifies the name of an area that is normally addressed by requests to this database. The name of this area will be removed from generated title path URLs, so the URLs are shorter.

option.TitlePathURL.MixedLanguages.title=Title path URLs: Allow mixed languages in URL
option.TitlePathURL.MixedLanguages.description=Enabling this will allow the generation of Title Path URLs where contents of different languages than the content addressed may be used to build the path. This is done only when the addressed content language is not available at a hierarchy position. The alternative language is chosen by the language behaviour in effect.

option.TitlePathURL.IncludeKeys.title=Title path URLs: Include document keys
option.TitlePathURL.IncludeKeys.description=Enabling this will make the title path URLs also contain the key of the addressed document. This makes addressation safer by eliminating problems with title changes and conflicts.

option.AJAX.KeepURLParams.title=Keep URL params on AJAX action requests
option.AJAX.KeepURLParams.description=Determines if AJAX action requests should include the URL parameters of the original request on their URL. This normally is determined by the compliance version of the design but can be set explicitly with this publisher option.
option.AJAX.KeepURLParams.value.default.title=Determined by version compliance of design
option.AJAX.KeepURLParams.value.true.title=Yes
option.AJAX.KeepURLParams.value.false.title=no

option.AJAX.ShowSessionExpiredMessage.title=Show session expired message on failed AJAX requests
option.AJAX.ShowSessionExpiredMessage.description=When an AJAX action fails because the session, for which the action link was created, is expired, then OpenWGA normally shows a message box in the users browser explaining this situation and then reloads the complete webpage. Disable this option if you do not want this box to be shown. In that case only the page reload happens.

option.UseLoginParameterOnContentURLs.title=Generate content URLs that force login when necessary
option.UseLoginParameterOnContentURLs.description=Enabling this will add an URL parameter "?login" to every generated content URL while the user is logged in. When someone else uses this URL to access a content which is not anonymously accessible then he is redirected to the login page instead of seeing a 404 error.

option.FileDerivates.Enabled.title=File Derivates
