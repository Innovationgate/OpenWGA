applyOverlayProblem.title=A problem occured customizing the design of application "{dbkey}"

applyOverlayProblem.resourceConflict.message=Conflicts between resources of the base design and its customization have been detected.
applyOverlayProblem.resourceConflict.description=You are using a higher version of your base design '{basedesign}' ({currentversion}) than this overlay was created on/updated to ({baseversion}). The following resources were modified in this newer base design, but also in your overlay: \n{conflicts}\nOpenWGA will use the version from the overlay for conflicting file containers/tml modules/script modules, ignoring changes in the base design. These however may not work as expected, as the newer base design may rely on their updated state.
applyOverlayProblem.resourceConflict.solution=You might want to upgrade your overlay design so it uses the new base design version (see WGA documentation on customizable designs). On that occasion conflicts on resources can be resolved. If you review the conflicts and find that they cannot cause problems you may also ignore this problem to stay compatible with the lower base version. This problem is only shown when the overlay is in an editable form, not when it is used as a distributed design plugin. 

applyOverlayProblem.wrongBase.message=The overlay design needs a different base design.
applyOverlayProblem.wrongBase.description=Each overlay design is created for a specific base design. The overlay design "{overlaydesign}" needs base design "{correctbase}" but is configured to use "{usedbase}". This cannot work.
applyOverlayProblem.wrongBase.solution=Configure your app to use the the correct base design "{correctbase}" with overlay design "{overlaydesign}".

applyOverlayProblem.invalidOverlay.message=The given overlay design "{overlaydesign}" cannot be used as overlay.
applyOverlayProblem.invalidOverlay.description=The design "{overlaydesign}" chosen for overlay does not contain overlay information and also is not empty. It therefor neither can be used as an existing overlay design nor can it be initialized as a new overlay.
applyOverlayProblem.invalidOverlay.solution=Check if you have really chosen the right design for your overlay. If you wanted to create a new overlay design check if the directory is really empty.
