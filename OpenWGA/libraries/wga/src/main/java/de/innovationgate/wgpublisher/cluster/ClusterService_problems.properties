clusterProblem.title=A problem regarding the OpenWGA cluster was detected
clusterProblem.clusterServiceDead.message=The cluster service is not operational
clusterProblem.clusterServiceDead.description=The cluster service is currently not operating normally. Therefor operations that need to be distributed on the cluster do not work, which may endanger system health.
clusterProblem.clusterServiceDead.solution=See the problem exception stack trace for the error that was raised checking for cluster health.

clusterProblem.differingKeys.message=The encryption differs between cluster nodes
clusterProblem.differingKeys.description=All cluster nodes need to use equal encryption keys and methods in order to let every request be processable by all cluster nodes. Node {node} seems to have a different key and/or hashing method than this server.
clusterProblem.differingKeys.solution=Ensure that the file "openwga.key" in OpenWGA configuration directory contains equal content on all cluster nodes. Also ensure that the server option "Hashing algorithm" (on section "Platform service choices") is configured equal among cluster nodes.

clusterProblem.noMemberInformation.message=The node {node} did not send member information
clusterProblem.noMemberInformation.description=This server was unable to obtain member information from cluster node {node}. The cause may be that there are different feature versions of OpenWGA in the cluster. If you are currently in the process of updating OpenWGA version on the cluster, having some nodes still on the old version, then this is expected behaviour. More information may be available in the application log.
clusterProblem.noMemberInformation.solution=Upgrade all cluster nodes to the largest feature version number of OpenWGA.
