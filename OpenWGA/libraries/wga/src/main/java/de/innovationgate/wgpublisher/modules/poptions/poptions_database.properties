option.PublishContentFilesWithDesignEncoding.title=Publish content files with design encoding
option.PublishContentFilesWithDesignEncoding.description=This is a legacy setting which controls, if the design encoding of an app is also used to read textual files that are stored on the content of that app, so they can be transcoded to the servers output encoding.

OpenWGA will however still declare the output charset to be its default output encoding.
